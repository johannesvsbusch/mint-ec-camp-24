    "# 5. Image Classification on Cifar10\n",
    "In the last notebook we used neural networks to classify handwritten digits in images. In this notebook we want to look at slightly more interesting images. The Cifar10 dataset is a collection of 32 x 32 pixel color images that fall into 10 categories. There is also a full Cifar dataset with more images, higher resolution, and more classes. However, since more complex data increases the time for training, we use Cifar10."
